# Godot 3D Multiplayer Template

This is a template for a 3D multiplayer game developed in Godot Engine 4.3. It provides a basic structure for a multiplayer setup, where each player has a nickname displayed above their character and the option to choose from four different skins: red, green, blue, or yellow. Additionally, the template includes a global multiplayer chat system for player communication.
